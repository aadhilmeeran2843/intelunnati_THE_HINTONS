In this message I am going to describe the way I submitted.
I recommend you to go through this repository in this order.

1) MODELS: 
          * In this folder i have included a word document which have the block diagram,
            Flow diagram, state diagram i have created to complete this project.

          * And I also included the verilog code also.

2) DATA: 
          In this folder i have included the output data of 
                 * Fitter / resource usage summary 
                 * timing analysis / summary, parallel compilation, multicorner time analysis summary, input transition time report 
                 * Power analysis / summary, parallel compilation
                 * compile design data / compilation log message
                 * Other output data 

3) CODE:
          This folder contains the verilog code, test bench, sof file.

4) Data:
          In this folder i included 
          * A compressed word document which have my report.
          * Output diagrams like 
                        I)  simulation output diagram,
                        II) State machine output diagram,
                        III) RTL viewer,
                        IV)  Technology map viewer (post mapping)
                         V)  Technology map viewer (post fitting)

5) Demo videos: 
                    Since the memory of the videos is large i given links for those videos
