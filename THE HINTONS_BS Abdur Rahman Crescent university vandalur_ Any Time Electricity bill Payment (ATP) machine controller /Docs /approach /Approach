Week 1:
                     • I created a block diagram of the given design. 
                     • I Identified proper inputs and outputs. 
                     • I created a FSM ( Mealy ) of the given design. 
                     • I created valid test cases [Test Plan].
Week 2:
                     • I developed the Verilog code of the given FSM.
                     • I developed the test bench and verified its functionality. 
                     • Then I analysed the code coverage reports.
Week 3:
		     • I have synthesized the developed HDL code.
 		    ]• Then I analysed the area and power report. 
                     • Then I have applied proper timing constraints and analysed the timing reports to achieve proper timing closure.
Week 4:
                     • In week 4 I have done the implementation part , I have already created a sram object file (Sof) 
            	        During the implementation part I have uploaded the Sof file into the target device.
		     • The target device is CYCLONE 5 - 5CSEMA5F31C6,
                        I implemented it virtually with the help of the Labsland and I got the outputs for the respective inputs in the target device.
