Week 1:
                     • We created a block diagram of the given design 
                     • We Identified proper inputs and outputs 
                     • We created a FSM ( Mealy ) of the given design 
                     • We created valid test cases [Test Plan]
Week 2:
                     • We developed the Verilog code of the given FSM
                     • We developed the test bench and verified its functionality 
                     • Then we analysed the code coverage reports
Week 3:
		                 • We have synthesized the developed HDL code
 		                 • Then we analysed the area and power report 
                     • Then we have applied proper timing constraints and analysed the timing reports to achieve proper timing closure
Week 4:
                     • In week 4 we have done the implementation part , we have already created a sram object file (Sof) . 
             During the implementation part we have uploaded the Sof file into the target device.
		                 • The target device is CYCLONE 5 - 5CSEMA5F31C6,
             we implemented it virtually with the help of the Labsland and we got the outputs for the respective inputs in the target device
